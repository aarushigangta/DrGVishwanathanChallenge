Reverse a Singly Linked List
This repository contains a Java implementation to reverse a singly linked list.

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list and return the new head.

ðŸ’¡ Example
Input:

Copy
Edit
1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 â†’ 4 â†’ 5
Output:

Copy
Edit
5 â†’ 4 â†’ 3 â†’ 2 â†’ 1
ðŸ§  Approach
The approach used is iterative reversal using three pointers:

prevnode â€“ initially null, holds the previous node.

currnode â€“ starts at head, traverses the list.

nextnode â€“ temporarily holds the next node.

Steps:
Iterate through the list.

For each node, reverse its next pointer.

Move forward by updating prevnode and currnode.
