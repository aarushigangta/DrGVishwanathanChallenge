**Problem statement**

Given a string columnTitle that represents the column title as appears in an Excel sheet, return its corresponding column number.

**Approach**

This is effectively a base-26 conversion problem, where:

'A' to 'Z' map to 1 to 26

Each character contributes to the overall number like digits in base-26
